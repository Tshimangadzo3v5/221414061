1. Introduction
This lab was designed to help me understand how different web servers and 
application servers operate, and how to deploy a basic website both locally and 
online. I learned to set up and run web pages using Apache (HTTP server), Tomcat 
(application server), and VS Code’s Live Server while exploring the difference 
between static and dynamic websites.
I developed a two-page website using HTML:
• Page 1: 221414061.html – introduces my career interests and includes links to 
professional platforms such as GitHub or LinkedIn.
• Page 2: project.html – outlines my proposed team project, including team 
member details formatted in a table and styled with basic HTML elements like 
headings, lists, background colors, and horizontal rules.
• An image folder for media content.
• An embedded sound that plays automatically when the first page loads.
Step 2: Setting Up the Local Environment
I installed XAMPP, which includes:
• Apache Server: for static and PHP-based pages.
• Tomcat Server: for Java-based JSP pages.

3. I then created a two-page website to understand how web and application servers 
work. Using VS Code Live Server on port 5500, I first previewed my static HTML site 
locally. I then used XAMPP’s Apache server (port 80) to test my HTML and PHP pages 
and Tomcat (port 8080) to run my dynamic JSP file. This process helped me learn the 
difference between static and dynamic websites, as well as how Apache handles 
PHP while Tomcat executes JSP. Overall, the activity taught me how to set up and 
deploy a website across different local environments and understand the role of each 
server in web hosting Difference between Web and Application Servers:
• Apache = serves static and PHP files.
• Tomcat = executes Java (JSP/Servlets).
Static vs. Dynamic Websites:
• Static = fixed content (HTML/CSS).
• Dynamic = generated in real time (PHP/JSP).
Ports and Server Access:
• Port 80 = Apache, Port 8080 = Tomcat, Port 5500 = Live Server.
Website Deployment:
• Learned to publish locally (using XAMPP) and globally (using GitHub Pages).
Practical Web Hosting Skills:
• Understanding how local servers simulate real hosting environments used by 
developers.

Conclusion
• This assignment taught me how web technologies function together —
from HTML creation to real-time dynamic scripting and online deployment. I 
now understand the roles of Apache, Tomcat, and PHP, how to deploy 
locally and online, and how to differentiate between static and 
dynamic websites
